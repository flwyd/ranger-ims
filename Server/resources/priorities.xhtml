  <h1>IMS Priorities</h1>

  <p>The Ranger IMS associates a priority level with each incident.  This can provide a way to identify incidents that need greater attention or can be safely ignored for a while, which may be useful for managing Operator and Khaki workload when there are many open incidents to manage.</p>

  <p>In order for priorities to be useful, however, it's important that they be used consistantly by all users.  To that end, the list below itemizes the priority levels and how they should be utilized:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>Emergency: we need to deal with this ASAP</li>
   <li>Urgent: we need to deal with this in a timely fashion</li>
   <li>Normal</li>
   <li>Not urgent: deal with this when resources are available</li>
   <li>Low priority: needs to stay open, but not actively being worked on</li>
  </ol>
